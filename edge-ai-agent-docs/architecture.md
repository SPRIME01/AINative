# Edge AI Agent Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the Edge AI Agent system, detailing the roles of individual agents, their interactions, and the overall structure of the system.

## System Architecture

### 1. Agent Roles
- **Strategist Agent**: Responsible for high-level decision-making and aligning daily tasks with long-term goals. It filters inputs through strategic lenses and prioritizes direction over tactics.
  
- **Builder Agent**: Focuses on code generation, debugging, and development operations. It transforms structured input into functional outputs, ensuring modularity and transparency.

- **Planner Agent**: Translates strategic goals into actionable plans. It organizes tasks, schedules, and checks feasibility to ensure effective execution.

- **Critic Agent**: Provides adversarial reasoning to challenge assumptions and identify risks. It helps improve outcomes by surfacing inconsistencies and blind spots.

- **Synthesizer Agent**: Integrates and synthesizes information from various sources into coherent summaries and insights. It creates higher-order abstractions and reduces redundancy.

- **Archivist Agent**: Captures and organizes outputs, ensuring long-term retrieval and contextual tagging. It acts as a knowledge repository for the system.

- **Watcher Agent**: Monitors system performance, logs, and outputs. It flags anomalies and provides health reports to ensure operational coherence.

### 2. Inter-Agent Communication
Agents communicate through a lightweight messaging protocol, allowing them to share information and coordinate tasks effectively. This communication is essential for maintaining alignment and ensuring that each agent can access the necessary data from others.

### 3. Data Flow
- **Input Data**: Agents receive input data from various sources, including user interactions, logs, and external databases.
- **Processing**: Each agent processes the input according to its role, utilizing quantized LLM models optimized for edge deployment.
- **Output Data**: The processed data is then outputted to relevant files, logs, or other agents, facilitating a continuous flow of information.

### 4. System Integration
The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new agents or functionalities. Each agent operates independently but contributes to the overall system goals, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

### 5. Performance Optimization
To enhance performance, the system employs runtime optimization strategies, including model swapping, shared embedding models, and efficient GPU scheduling. These strategies ensure that the agents operate effectively within the constraints of the edge AI environment.

## Conclusion
The Edge AI Agent architecture is a cohesive system designed to leverage the strengths of individual agents while ensuring efficient communication and data flow. This architecture supports the project's goals of enhancing productivity and facilitating intelligent decision-making in an edge AI context.
