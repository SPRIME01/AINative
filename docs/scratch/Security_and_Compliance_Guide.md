# Edge AI Agent System: Security and Compliance Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations, compliance requirements, and best practices for implementing and operating the Edge AI Agent System. Operating AI agents on edge hardware presents unique security challenges that must be addressed systematically to ensure data protection, system integrity, and regulatory compliance.

## Security Architecture

### Defense-in-Depth Approach

The Edge AI Agent System implements a defense-in-depth security approach with multiple layers of protection:

1. **Hardware Security**
   - Secure boot leveraging NVIDIA Jetson security features
   - Hardware-level encryption (if supported by the device)
   - Physical access controls and tamper detection

2. **System Security**
   - Minimal OS installation with unnecessary services disabled
   - Regular security updates and patch management
   - Host-based firewall configuration
   - Security-hardened container environments

3. **Application Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Authentication and authorization controls
   - Secure API design principles

4. **Data Security**
   - Encryption for sensitive data at rest
   - Access controls for artifacts and agent configurations
   - Secure deletion practices
   - Backup encryption

### Authentication and Authorization

The system implements a comprehensive identity and access management framework:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Identity Management"
        Auth[Authentication Service]
        Users[User Repository]
        Roles[Role Definitions]
        Auth --> Users
        Auth --> Roles
    end

    subgraph "Authorization Layer"
        AuthZ[Authorization Service]
        Policies[Policy Repository]
        AuthZ --> Policies
    end

    subgraph "Resource Access"
        Projects[Projects]
        Artifacts[Artifacts]
        Agents[Agents]
        API[API Endpoints]
    end

    Auth --> AuthZ
    AuthZ --> Projects
    AuthZ --> Artifacts
    AuthZ --> Agents
    AuthZ --> API
```

1. **Authentication Methods**
   - API key authentication for programmatic access
   - Username/password with MFA for user interfaces
   - OAuth2/OpenID Connect for third-party integration
   - JWT-based token management

2. **Authorization Model**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for system-wide permissions
   - Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained artifact access
   - Resource ownership and delegation
   - Permission inheritance based on project hierarchy

3. **Identity Lifecycle Management**
   - User provisioning and deprovisioning
   - Temporary access and time-based expiration
   - Credential rotation and management
   - Audit of identity changes

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

All data in the Edge AI Agent System is classified according to sensitivity level:

| Classification | Description | Examples | Protection Measures |
|----------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| Public | Non-sensitive information | Open-source artifacts, public documentation | Basic access controls |
| Internal | Business information not for public disclosure | Project plans, team assignments | Role-based access, basic encryption |
| Confidential | Sensitive information | Proprietary algorithms, competitive research | Strong encryption, strict access limits, audit logging |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive information | Personal data, trade secrets | End-to-end encryption, compartmentalized access, enhanced monitoring |

### Data Handling Procedures

1. **Data Collection**
   - Collect only necessary data (data minimization)
   - Clearly document data sources and lineage
   - Validate data integrity upon collection

2. **Data Storage**
   - Encrypt confidential and restricted data at rest
   - Implement time-to-live (TTL) policies for temporary data
   - Securely store encryption keys separate from data

3. **Data Processing**
   - Process data in secure memory spaces
   - Implement least privilege for processing agents
   - Sanitize inputs and outputs to prevent injection attacks

4. **Data Transmission**
   - Encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.3+
   - Validate endpoints before transmission
   - Implement bandwidth limiting to prevent data exfiltration

5. **Data Deletion**
   - Securely delete data when no longer needed
   - Implement retention policies based on data classification
   - Maintain deletion logs for audit purposes

## Agent Security Controls

### Agent Isolation

Each agent operates within a controlled environment with specifically defined boundaries:

1. **Process Isolation**
   - Each agent runs in a separate process or container
   - Resource limits prevent denial-of-service
   - Memory isolation prevents cross-agent contamination

2. **Filesystem Isolation**
   - Chroot or container filesystem isolation
   - Read-only mounts for system resources
   - Temporary filesystem for transient operations

3. **Network Isolation**
   - Internal network segmentation
   - Agent-specific firewall rules
   - Traffic filtering based on agent purpose

### Agent Behavior Controls

Mechanisms to ensure agents behave as intended:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Sanitize all inputs to agents, including prompts and parameters
   - Validate structured data against schemas
   - Apply rate limits to prevent abuse

2. **Output Filtering**
   - Inspect agent outputs for sensitive information
   - Apply content filters to prevent harmful outputs
   - Implement output rate limiting

3. **Behavioral Monitoring**
   - Track resource usage patterns
   - Monitor API calls and communication patterns
   - Alert on anomalous behavior

### Custom Agent Security

Special considerations for custom agents created by users:

1. **Sandboxing**
   - Run in highly restricted environments
   - Limited tool access based on purpose
   - Pre-execution validation of agent configuration

2. **Grounding Verification**
   - Verify grounding artifacts don't contain malicious content
   - Scan for sensitive information before use
   - Validate tool usage permissions

3. **External Libraries**
   - Scan external dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Validate signatures and integrity
   - Restrict network access during execution

## Regulatory Compliance

   ```python
   def process_agent_request(request: Dict) -> Dict:
       """Process a request to an agent with proper error handling."""
       try:
           # Validate the request
           if not validate_request(request):
               return {"error": "Invalid request format", "code": "INVALID_FORMAT"}

           # Process the request
           result = agent_processor.process(request)
           return {"result": result}

       except AuthorizationError as e:
           logger.error(f"Authorization error: {str(e)}")
           return {"error": "Not authorized", "code": "UNAUTHORIZED"}

       except RateLimitError as e:
           logger.warning(f"Rate limit exceeded: {str(e)}")
           return {"error": "Rate limit exceeded", "code": "RATE_LIMITED"}

       except Exception as e:
           # Log the full error for internal debugging
           logger.exception(f"Unexpected error processing request: {str(e)}")
           # Return a generic error message to the user
           return {"error": "Internal processing error", "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR"}
   ```

3. **Secure Communications**
   ```python
   def setup_agent_communication(agent_id: str) -> CommunicationClient:
       """Set up secure communication for an agent."""
       # Create client with TLS configuration
       client = CommunicationClient(
           cert_path=f"/certs/{agent_id}/cert.pem",
           key_path=f"/certs/{agent_id}/key.pem",
           ca_path="/certs/ca/ca.pem",
           verify=True,
           cipher_suites=SECURE_CIPHER_SUITES
       )

       # Set up mutual TLS
       client.enable_mtls()

       return client
   ```
