# Project Overview

## Introduction
The Edge AI Agent project is designed to leverage the capabilities of quantized LLM models on edge devices, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin 64GB developer kit. This project aims to create a collaborative team of intelligent agents that assist users in enhancing productivity, managing tasks, and executing projects efficiently.

## Goals
- **Develop a Multi-Agent System**: Create a set of lightweight, quantized LLM-based agents that operate locally to support various functions such as planning, coding, research, and knowledge management.
- **Optimize for Edge Deployment**: Ensure that all agents are optimized for performance and resource usage on edge devices, taking into account the hardware constraints of the Jetson AGX Orin.
- **Facilitate Personal Productivity**: Provide users with tools that help streamline workflows, improve task management, and enhance decision-making processes.

## Context
The project operates within the context of edge AI, where computational resources are limited compared to traditional cloud environments. The agents are designed to work collaboratively, each specializing in different aspects of project management and execution. This approach allows for efficient use of resources while maintaining high levels of performance and responsiveness.

## Structure
The project is organized into several key components:
- **Agents**: Each agent has a specific role and set of responsibilities, documented in individual files. These include the Strategist, Builder, Planner, Critic, Synthesizer, Archivist, and Watcher agents.
- **Concepts**: This section covers foundational concepts such as the Model Context Protocol and runtime optimization strategies that underpin the functionality of the agents.
- **Usage**: Guides for daily and weekly routines provide users with structured approaches to interacting with the agents and maximizing their effectiveness.
- **Architecture**: An overview of the system architecture illustrates how the agents interact and the relationships between them.

## Conclusion
The Edge AI Agent project represents a significant step towards creating intelligent, self-managing systems that can operate effectively in edge environments. By leveraging the capabilities of quantized LLM models, this project aims to enhance productivity and streamline workflows for users in various domains.
