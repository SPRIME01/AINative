# Edge AI Agent Documentation

## Overview
The Edge AI Agent project is designed to create a collaborative system of lightweight, quantized LLM-based agents that operate locally on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin 64GB developer kit. These agents assist users in enhancing productivity, project execution, and technical work through efficient task management and intelligent automation.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to leverage edge AI technology to facilitate personal and professional productivity by deploying a set of specialized agents. Each agent is tailored to perform specific roles, ensuring a comprehensive approach to task management and knowledge retention.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/edge-ai-agent-docs.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```
   cd edge-ai-agent-docs
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed for running the agents. Refer to the individual agent documentation for specific requirements.

## Getting Started
1. **Review the Project Overview**
   Familiarize yourself with the project's goals and context by reading `project_overview.md`.

2. **Explore Agent Documentation**
   Each agent has its own documentation file located in the `agents` directory. Review the roles, system prompts, tools, and access policies for each agent:
   - Strategist Agent: `agents/strategist_agent.md`
   - Builder Agent: `agents/builder_agent.md`
   - Planner Agent: `agents/planner_agent.md`
   - Critic Agent: `agents/critic_agent.md`
   - Synthesizer Agent: `agents/synthesizer_agent.md`
   - Archivist Agent: `agents/archivist_agent.md`
   - Watcher Agent: `agents/watcher_agent.md`

3. **Understand Key Concepts**
   Read the `concepts` directory files to grasp essential concepts such as the Model Context Protocol and runtime optimization strategies:
   - Model Context Protocol: `concepts/model_context_protocol.md`
   - Runtime Optimization: `concepts/runtime_optimization.md`

4. **Follow Usage Guidelines**
   Refer to the `usage` directory for daily and weekly routines to effectively utilize the agents:
   - Daily Routine: `usage/daily_routine.md`
   - Weekly Routine: `usage/weekly_routine.md`

5. **Review System Architecture**
   Gain insights into the overall architecture of the system by reading `architecture.md`, which outlines the relationships between agents and their interactions.
