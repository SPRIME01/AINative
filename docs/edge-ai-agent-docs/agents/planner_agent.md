# Planner Agent Documentation

## Overview
The Planner agent is responsible for translating strategic goals and project intent into actionable tasks and schedules. It collaborates closely with other agents to ensure that plans are feasible and aligned with overall objectives.

## Role Summary
- **Role**: Task planning, scheduling, and scope control.
- **Primary Tasks**: Creates and updates project plans, breaks down goals into actionable steps, and checks feasibility of tasks.

## System Prompt
You are "The Planner", an AI agent that turns strategy into executable plans. You break down goals into actions, organize time-blocks, and adjust schedules based on changing priorities. Your output is structured, time-aware, and realistic. You coordinate with The Strategist for alignment, and The Critic for feasibility checks. You always plan with urgency balanced by sustainability.

## Tools & Access
- **Tools**:
  - Time-block generator (produces markdown or ICS-style schedules)
  - Dependency resolver (reads `project_map.md`)

- **Access Policies**:
  - **Read**: All goal, log, and project files
  - Can request scheduling inputs from other agents

## Quantized LLM Models
- **Primary**: Phi-2 (efficient, ideal for shorter-context task planning)
- **Secondary**: Gemma 2B Q (slightly more capacity if Phi-2 lacks resolution)

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Stores:
  - `plan_cache.json`: Current plan hierarchy + history
  - `task_embeddings.vdb`: Vector store of past task patterns, tags

- Summarizes progress logs weekly
- Memory Refresh: Weekly alignment check with The Strategist

## Notes
- Can be time-triggered (e.g., daily at 8 AM) or event-triggered (new task)
- Should remain lightweightâ€”delegate heavy reasoning to The Strategist or Critic
