## Overview
The  Agent Context Protocol (ACP) is a structured method by which agents manage their context windows and persistent memory. It is essential for ensuring that agents can effectively summarize, retrieve, and reference previous information across sessions, particularly in edge AI environments where resource constraints are a significant consideration.

## Importance
ACP is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of AI agents, especially when operating on devices with limited computational resources. By optimizing how context is handled, agents can provide more relevant outputs while minimizing memory usage.

## Structure
The ACP consists of several key components:

1. **Input Pruning**: This involves determining what information is passed into the context window for each call. Agents should prioritize relevant data to enhance processing efficiency.

2. **Summarization Strategy**: Agents utilize various summarization techniques, such as sliding window approaches or long-term abstractions, to condense information and maintain context over time.

3. **Embedding Usage**: To simulate memory recall, agents leverage vector search techniques, allowing them to retrieve relevant past interactions or data points based on their embeddings.

4. **Protocol Structure**: This defines how agents store intermediate or long-term state information, including the types of files or data structures used for memory management.

## Implementation
The implementation of the ACP within the project involves the following steps:

- **Define Context Windows**: Establish the size and scope of context windows for each agent based on their specific roles and tasks.

- **Integrate Summarization Techniques**: Implement summarization methods that align with the agents' operational needs, ensuring that they can efficiently condense and retrieve information.

- **Utilize Vector Databases**: Set up vector databases to facilitate quick access to past interactions and enhance the agents' ability to recall relevant information.

- **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the performance of the ACP and make adjustments as necessary to optimize agent interactions and memory usage.

## Conclusion
The  is a foundational element of the edge AI agent system, enabling agents to operate effectively within their resource constraints while maintaining a high level of performance and relevance in their outputs.
