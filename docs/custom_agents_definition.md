# Custom Agent Definitions

Custom agents are specialized AI entities that can be part of a project team. They are distinct from the core 8 system agents and the dedicated Project Manager AI agents.

## Characteristics:

-   **Nature:** These are AI agents that can function as team members within a project.
-   **Behavior Types:** Custom agents can be:
    -   Autonomous
    -   Semi-autonomous
    -   Reactive
    -   Scheduled
-   **Creation and Grounding:**
    -   Custom agents are created using artifacts for grounding. These artifacts provide the context, knowledge, and operational parameters for the agent.
    -   They function somewhat like "little sandboxes," operating within the scope defined by their grounding artifacts.
-   **Technology:** Custom agents are implemented as SmolAgents.
-   **Artifact Transparency:**
    -   Users can typically view the artifacts that a custom agent is made of.
    -   The creator of a custom agent has the option to lock access to these grounding artifacts.
-   **Sharing and Reusability:**
    -   Custom agents can be published to a shared or general library.
    -   This allows other users to utilize these pre-built custom agents in their own projects.
-   **Assignment:**
    -   Custom agents (like other team members) can be assigned, unassigned, or reassigned to specific projects or tasks.
    -   They can share or own artifacts within the project context.
